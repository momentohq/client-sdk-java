     * These two executors are used by {@link RetryClientInterceptor} to schedule and execute
     * retries on failed gRPC requests. One is a single threaded scheduling executor {@link
     * ScheduledExecutorService} that's only responsible to schedule retries with a given delay. The
     * other executor {@link ThreadPoolExecutor} is a dynamic executor that spawns threads as
     * necessary and executes the retries (essentially doing the I/O work).
     *
     * <p>{@link ScheduledExecutorService} creates idle threads and hence the choice of using two
     * executors. The small overhead of a single thread doing the scheduling negates the
     * implications of creating potentially hundreds of idle threads with the
     * ScheduledExecutorService. This executor is chosen to avoid a Thread.sleep() while doing
     * retries. There are no available configurations to ScheduledExecutorService such that it grows
     * dynamically.
     *
     * <p>The {@link ThreadPoolExecutor} has a size of 0 and grows onDemand. The maximumPoolSize is
     * present to cap the number of threads we create for retries; where the {@link
     * LinkedBlockingQueue} essentially stores any pending retries. Note that the keep alive time
     * for each thread is 60 seconds, beyond which the JVM will destroy the thread. This is the
     * default value of {@link Executors.newCachedThreadPool()} and also applies in our situation as
     * even with backoffs, one retry should be below 60 seconds. We aren't directly using a cached
     * thread pool because it grows unbounded.
